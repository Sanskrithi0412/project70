        </p>We have an amphi theatre near the middle schoolers. This is where we usually conduct class assembly. That is the image of the stage where we present and perform section by section. In front of the stage, there are large steps where the students from the remaining sections sit and watch.Sometimes, we use the amphi theatre for special events. For example, last year, we conducted an event to welcome students from a foreign country as a part of our foriegn exchange programme.

        </p>The school has a huge sport's ground of 12000 square metres.Trust me, you don't want to be punished by running even one round around the ground.We have a variety of sports for everyone to try out. Some of the sports are football, basketball, dodgeball, throwball, kho kho, tennis, badminton, chess, golf, handball, squash, kabaddi and many more. We have many inter school competitons here as well. Also, the school assemblies and events that include almost the entire school are taken place here.For example, the 2019 teacher's day celebration was held in the sport's ground.And luckily, we have the cafeteria and a tuck shop near the ground for when we get famished.

            <p>Inter School Creative Writing Contest was held at Delhi Public School, Bangalore East in August 2019 for the students of Grades V-X. Twenty three schools across Bangalore had participated in this competition. It gives me immense pleasure to share that the students of our school have done exceedingly well in this contest. Nine students have won positions in different categories.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The school started working on transferring our pool to an indoor pool at the one week of our offline classes. During my online class, we got a video that the indoor pool was ready. The pool is built where we used to have our cafeteria but we have another cafeteria and a food truck so... not really a problem. We also have a new squash court, a new block for classes and a bridge joining two blocks. We get all updates about our school from our school website and our youtube channel.  </p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">We also have a new squash court somewhere around the cafeteria. It is our second squash court. Recently, a lot of special sports have been introduced in the school like hockey, handball, billiards and well squash. Squash has actually become a popular sport for many of the students here. PE is the most loved part of the school was most of the students. </p>
